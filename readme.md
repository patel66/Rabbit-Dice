Gameplay
----------

A player is randomly picked to go first.

There should be 13 dice in the cup at this point.

On your turn, the first thing he/she does is roll three dice:
	If a die rolls up meat, that means you captured the rabbit
	If a die rolls up paws, that means the rabbit dodged your capture
	If a die rolls up blast, that means the rabbit shot you with their revolver.

All rolled dice stay on the table.

If at any point you have 3 bullet wounds (3 blast dice), your turn is over and you do not score.

After rolling your 3 dice, if you are still alive, you have two options:
	Walk Away - you end your turn and score points for each meat die you rolled.
	Keep Hunting - you decide to roll 3 more dice to try to capture more wabbits. You also risk your own demise.

If you decide to keep hunting, place any paw dice on the table into your hand, then draw new dice from the cup until you have 3 in your hand. Go to step 3.
